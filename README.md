# TNSimulation
The Simulation tracking antenna system is a very complex design. In order to test it, it will require outdoor testing which involves a big amount of personnel, time, equipment, drones, pilots and licensing this effort will be long and expensive. In order to make the outdoor testing as short as it can, indoor testing should be held. The solution suggested is to build a software simulation that will imitate the operation of an airborne unit flying on a specific pattern and will imitate a real-time operation. After each test, a comparison of the required and actual parameters shall be analyzed and will indicate mismatches
